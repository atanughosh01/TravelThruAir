# TravelThruAir
An online flight booking site made of servlets as backend and jsp as frontend

### Problem Statement

Implement a web application named “Travel Thru Air” using servlets to support the following two use cases-
  1. A list of current special deals must appear on the home page. Each special deal must display the departure  city, the arrival city, and the cost. These special deals are set up by the marketing department and change  during the day, so it can’t be static. Special deals are only good for a limited amount of time. 
  2. A user may search for flights, given a departure city, time and an arrival city. The results must display  the departure city, the arrival city, the total cost, and how many legs the flight will have.

  State and explain why and where you have used design patterns. If possible, please write the front end using React  JS (https://reactjs.org) or Thymeleaf (https://www.thymeleaf.org).
